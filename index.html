      <h2>Why I Admire APJ Abdul Kalam</h2>
      <div class="content-container">
        <p>
          APJ Abdul Kalam's life and work have been a source of inspiration for
          millions of people. His dedication to science and technology, his
          humility, and his vision for a better India are just a few of the
          reasons why he is admired by many.
        </p>
        <p>
          He played a pivotal role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
          which established India as a nuclear power. His contributions to the
          Indian space program and missile development efforts have been
          instrumental in making India self-reliant in defense technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from his scientific achievements, Kalam was also a prolific
          writer and educator. He authored several books, including "Wings of
          Fire," "Ignited Minds," and "India 2020," which continue to inspire
          young minds across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kalam's vision for India was to transform it into a developed nation
          by 2020. He believed in the power of education, innovation, and
          self-reliance to achieve this goal. His speeches and interactions with
          students and young professionals have left a lasting impact on
          generations.
